Through 2016, S I Drilling has been drilling holes to a maximum depth of 50m using 300mm, 250mm, 200mm and 150mm casing. Alongside this, we are installing valuable stainless steel standpipes in some of the boreholes that will be used in a pumping and filtration process to help clean the soils.

The site's hazardous nature has required our skilled team to undertake additional health and safety measures.

Willoughby Lane is an 100 acre old gas works site, situated near Edmonton. The site is registered as a RED site, with large gas holders that had leaked gas oil into the ground over many years.
