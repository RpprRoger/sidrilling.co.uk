Bob Maclaren started as a ‘second-man’ in 1989 working for a local drilling company. Within a year Bob, operating as a sole trader, started SI Drilling with a single drilling unit.

He took his experience of working within the construction industry as a cable percussion (CP) driller and founded S I Drilling Cable Percussion Ltd in 1995.

Today we have nine operational drilling rigs and have grown to be one of the countries most respected CP drilling providers and consultants.
