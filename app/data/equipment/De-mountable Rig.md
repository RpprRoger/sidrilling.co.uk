Capable of drilling to depths of 40m
This rig can be disassembled and carried through buildings, up or down stairs using a Stair Climber and then assembled at the borehole position.
Again this rig is used in basements, warehouses and difficult to access projects. We have full 30m+ of fume extraction to accompany this rig when required
To achieve this depth the borehole would be cased to a maximum depth of 25m then open holed to 40m, using 200mm/150mm casing size. In the right drilling conditions 250mm could be used to a max depth of 5m.
PowerPlant: Yanmar 10BH (single cylinder)

- Min width of De-mountable rig 600mm
- Min drill height - 2.3m
